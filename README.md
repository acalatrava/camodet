# camodet
Lightweight Simple CAmera MOtion DEtection application. 

Tired of looking for an application that could do motion detection on my own surveillance cameras I decided to create it.
The existing solutions were too complicated to install and set up, too slow, abandoned or simply didn't work.

camodet is ultra lightweight, portable and fast, it can be run in a raspberry pi or similar.

## Compile
Depends on OpenCV3 and CMake.

1) mkdir build
2) cd build
3) cmake ..
4) make
done!
